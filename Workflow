Workflow

Creating a workflow for the migration of A Fable of the Scriptkiddie Scriptoria from Notion to 
GitHub with website, wiki, and PDF automation involves several steps and tools. Here's a potential 
approach:

**1. Data Source and Version Control:**

* **Migrate your Notion content:** Choose a tool like Notion-to-Markdown or notion-exporter to 
transfer your book content from Notion to markdown files. These files will serve as your source 
code and be stored in a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
* **Version control:** Leverage Git and GitHub to track changes in your book's content. Git 
branches can be used for different book versions or drafts.

**2. Website Generation:**

* **Static site generator:** Use a static site generator like Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, or MkDocs to 
convert your markdown files into HTML for website display. Choose one that best suits your 
technical expertise and desired website features.
* **Theme and customization:** Choose a theme that aligns with your book's style and customize it
further if needed. Most static site generators offer theme options and customization possibilities.
* **Deployment:** Deploy your generated website directly to GitHub Pages, a free hosting service 
offered by GitHub. This integrates seamlessly with your Git repository and updates automatically 
with new commits.

**3. Wiki Integration:**

* **GitHub Wiki:** Utilize GitHub's built-in wiki feature to create a dedicated knowledge base for 
your book. You can link from your website to relevant wiki pages for additional information or 
reference material.
* **Keep wiki content consistent:** Manually maintain the wiki content to ensure consistency with 
your book's main content. Alternatively, explore potential third-party tools for automated wiki 
updates from markdown files.

**4. PDF Generation:**

* **Pandoc:** Utilize Pandoc, a powerful document converter, to transform your markdown files into
various formats like PDF, ePub, and docx. You can integrate Pandoc into your build process through 
tools like Hugo or MkDocs.
* **LaTeX (optional):** For more complex layouts or typesetting needs, consider using LaTeX with 
pandoc to generate high-quality PDF outputs.

**5. Automation:**

* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline with 
tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI. This automates the process of building your website, wiki, 
and PDF whenever you push changes to your Git repository.
* **Versioning and deployment**: Integrate your CI/CD pipeline with versioning tools like Semantic 
Versioning to manage different book versions and automatically deploy website and PDF updates based
on new releases.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Consider using markdown extensions:** Explore markdown extensions like Markdown Math for 
writing mathematical equations or YAML front matter for metadata management.
* **Document your workflow:** Create a detailed workflow document outlining the steps for building,
deploying, and updating your book across different formats. This will streamline future maintenance
and collaboration.
* **Community resources:** Each tool and technology mentioned here has active communities with 
extensive documentation and tutorials. Don't hesitate to seek help and guidance if needed.

Remember, this is a general workflow outline, and specific tools and configurations may vary based
on your preferences and technical expertise. Research and compare tools to find the ones that best 
suit your project needs. Good luck with creating and publishing your books!
