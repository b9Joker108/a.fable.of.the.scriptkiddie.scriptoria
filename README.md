A Fable of the Scriptkiddie Scriptoria: A Bash/Zsh roadmap/study-guide, leveraging the GNU/Linux shell 
&amp; Termux scripting environment w/~ Android: unrooted, PRoot to root!

This project is still under active development. As the principal Markdown file in this repository, is 
too large to render in the GitHub webapp Markdown editor/viewer, I am now developing it with Gitbook, 
which syncs with the GitHub repository. I have connected GitHub with Gitbook, but am yet to commit 
updates from the Gitbook webapp, to the GitHub repository. I will probably take in excess of another 
month to do so. My interest has also been whetted by MDBook and Pandoc, for further stages and evolutes,
of this project. I have them both installed in Termux, but am yet to engage them.

Recently, instead of expressly and dedicatedly, working on this project directly, I have been working 
on its subprojects, that directly feed into it. Such as, iterating my local dotfiles and dotdirectories 
on my local system, into accord with both the Dotly and Dorothy dotfiles management systems, ecosystems
and frameworks. Given that I currently have circa eighteen (18) Un*x/*NIX shells in my host Termux 
environment (let alone numerous guest environments, which are currently independent of this first project 
stage), this is a significant undertaking. 

Harmonising Dotly and Dorothy locally, and learning their machinations, documenting my learnings for this
project, cleansing it of all of secrets, and commiting to their dedicated GitHub repository, and adapting
my local installation and usecase to this, is a much greater, convoluted and involved process, than I ever
anticipated. This will constitute a primary resource to this project.

Dorothy does many things, such as, for example, enabling the exportation and synchronisation between 
dotfiles and dotdirectories on local, external and disparate systems and environments. But, I am yet to 
fully commence integrating Dorothy, as Dotly, is taking a considerable, nay inordinate to exhorbitant, 
indeed, excesdive, period of time. Please appreciate the hyperbole. Moreover, the local dotfiles and 
dotdirectories system is also complex due to the local installation of Bash's ble.sh and bash-it, even 
though I favour Zsh and Oh My Zsh!, I am moving to a much more dispassionate shell-agnosticism and 
inclusiveness, in this project, as well as personal usage and workflow. The ble.sh and bash-it projects,
along with Oh My Zsh!, convey what may be done for a greater, inclusive, shell scripting ecosystem and 
integrated culture, of subcultures and shell dialects, as auspice and purview. I intend to seed, curry 
and encourage, with these projects, subsuming the establishment of an international non-profit foundation,
to support and administrate a centralised, yet decentralised auspice, for shell scripting glocally, with 
attendant knowledgebase accessible by the commmunity, and a dedicated, open source, defensible, research 
journal, dedicated to shell scripting, in its greatest and most inclusive purview, subsuming historicity, 
development, futures, benchmarking, extensibility, technological anthropology, indeed, all 
interdisciplinary areas and intersections. 

That said, the first complete draft, is focussing largely, only on shell interactive and scripting 
aspects and acquision and learnings, of: POSIX compliance, Bash and Zsh. Given the computational shells' 
ubiquity, extensibility, virility, granularity and reach, and the facility, amenity and capability, they 
ford all areas of human knowledge, activity and enquiry. Having no dedicated foundation as a locus and 
focus, and no concerted and centralised forum for scientific and academic treatment and publication, in 
regards to the computation shell, is an absolute nonsense, indefensible, irresponsible and dangerous.
