A Fable of the Scriptkiddie Scriptoria: A Bash/Zsh roadmap/study-guide, leveraging the GNU/Linux shell 
&amp; Termux scripting environment w/~ Android: unrooted, PRoot to root!

This project is still under active development. As the principal Markdown file in this repository, is 
too large to render in the GitHub webapp Markdown editor/viewer, I am now developing it with Gitbook, 
which syncs with the GitHub repository. I have connected GitHub with Gitbook, but am yet to commit 
updates from the Gitbook webapp, to the GitHub repository. I will probably take in excess of another 
month to do so. My interest has also been whetted by MDBook and Pandoc, for further stages and evolutes,
of this project. I have them both installed in Termux, but am yet to engage them. This page is currently
repetitive in content and has not received considered and qualitative editing. Please read with this 
caveat as disclaimer.

Recently, instead of expressly and dedicatedly, working on the textual roadmap and central and primary
deliverable od the project directly, I have been working on its subprojects and tangentials, that
directly feed into it, as process-flows. Such as, iterating my local dotfiles and dotdirectories 
on my local system, into accord with both the Dotly and Dorothy dotfiles management systems, ecosystems
and frameworks. Given that I currently have circa eighteen (18) Un*x/*NIX shells in my host Termux 
environment (let alone numerous guest environments, which are currently independent of this first project 
stage), this is a significant undertaking. 

Harmonising Dotly and Dorothy locally, and learning their machinations, documenting my learnings for this
project, cleansing it of all of secrets, and commiting to their dedicated GitHub repository, and adapting
my local installation and usecase to this, is a much greater, convoluted and involved process, than I ever
anticipated. This will constitute a primary resource, as deliverable and foci, for the audience of this 
shell scripting acquisition roadmap and project.

Dorothy does many things, such as, for example, enabling the exportation and synchronisation between 
dotfiles and dotdirectories on local, external and disparate systems and environments. But, I am yet to 
fully commence integrating Dorothy, as Dotly, is taking a considerable, nay inordinate to exhorbitant, 
indeed, excessive, period of time. Please appreciate the hyperbole. Moreover, the local dotfiles and 
dotdirectories system is also complex due to the local installation of Bash's ble.sh and bash-it, even 
though I favour Zsh and Oh My Zsh!, I am moving to a much more dispassionate shell-agnosticism and 
inclusiveness, in this project, as well as personal usage and workflow. The ble.sh and bash-it projects,
along with Oh My Zsh!, convey what may be done for a greater, inclusive, shell scripting ecosystem and 
integrated culture, of subcultures and shell dialects, as auspice and purview. That said, it is my 
considered opinional, that Nushell, is the, current, dominant, shell-of-the-future, due to its design 
philosophy and engineering considerations, and in its complete break with the delimitation and constraint 
and developmental throttle, forded by POXIX, as a historicism set in historicity,vand constitutes a fresh-
take and back to first-principles design considerations, with developers' beginner's mind(s), envisioning
and revisioning the potentialities, possibilities, and applications of the Unix-like shell, for current 
and furure contextualities and egent8ations. 

That said, I intend to seed, curry and encourage, with these projects, subsuming the establishment of an 
international non-profit foundation, to support and administrate a centralised, yet decentralised auspice, 
for shell scripting glocally, with attendant knowledgebase accessible by the commmunity, and a dedicated, 
open source, defensible, research journal, dedicated to shell scripting, in its greatest and most inclusive 
purview, subsuming historicity, development, futures, benchmarking, extensibility, technological 
anthropology, indeed, all interdisciplinary areas and intersections. 

That said, the first complete draft, is focussing largely, only on shell interactive and scripting 
aspects and acquision and learnings, of: POSIX compliance, Bash and Zsh, and my personal experience 
and self-reflections, in relation to the process. Given the computational shells' ubiquity, extensibility, 
virility, granularity and reach, and the facility, amenity and capability, they ford all areas of human
knowledge, activity and enquiry. Having no dedicated foundation as a locus and focus, and no concerted 
and centralised forum for scientific and academic treatment and publication, in regards to the 
computation shell, is an absolute nonsense, indefensible, irresponsible and dangerous.

PROJECT AUSPICE AND OVERVIEW

I feel it is useful to here to restate my purpose for undergoing the production of this work, to clarify both for myself and my audience, and my possible future co-maintainers and co-developers. These premier selected works are practically, theoretically and experientially aligned with my principal purpose in this undertaking, which is to realise a premier and singular 'index' for my Skriptkiddie project, that is: intelligent, interactive, historical, developmental, referential and an evolving knowledge graph, that is the conceptual and topical key to the Skriptkiddie work, and along with the web-site published form of Skriptkiddie, is to form a syncretic Web-application, and is inter-referencing and indexing the Skriptkiddie roadmap's ontological domain, subsuming, and upon which is mapped, an open source wiki, that is administrated, governed and hosted by a dedicated auspice, that is a glocal foundation and non-profit, focalising local independant chapters, with a centralised, attendant, open source journal, for computational shell: history, development, evolution, pedagogy; and subsumes a central library and showcase of shell scripts. The project is to foreground shell-agnosticism, perceiving each shell as a dialectical varietal that is systemic and that exists within a complex digital system and ecosystem, and actively fosters and supports the aquisition of shell scripting prowess, art and discipline, across-the-board, in its greatest multidisciplinary purview, subsuming intersections, applications, extensibilities, and possible futures, in possible worlds. This work will focus principally on the data back-end requirements, of this full-stack project. Python excells at back-end logistics, data manipulation and data visualisations, but this work will actively integrate with full-stack design, development, engineering and systemic, considerations and eventualities. The chosen Web-app technological (full-)stack wil consist of a broad set of UNIX(R) POSIX and non-POSIX shells, Python (with Mojo extensibility, and with shell and shell scripting integrations), for the back-end, data management, manipulation and visualisation, with Javascript, for the front-end, at which it excells and is ubiquitous. The full-stack system database and API technology and protocol, are yet-to-be-determined, with veracity. The principal focus and locus, of this Pythonic acquisition roadmap, will be documenting my realisation of this facet, of the greater project auspice and its deliverables. This work (like all the others), will be an experiential and reflective case-study, grounded in this particular usecase, which qualifies it amongst the glut of Pythonic print media, and will serve ae a manual to inform those in future, who will maintain the project, and its evolutions and emergent evolutes, into posterity and perpetuity, ensuring its longevity, continued and honed relevence, and domain centrality. This is my grand and somewhat grandiose vision and it is functional, ideological, precise, purposeful, important, vital and realisable.
